What is Cryptocup?
Cryptocup is the first World Cup prediction game in the blockchain. Players are able to build their own tokens by setting their own predictions. Each token is customizable and unique as it holds the player's choices. Players will earn points when comparing their predictions with the real results. Those with more points will be rewarded by redeeming their prize from the Smart Contract.
